Welcome to Stratora Docs — the official documentation for Stratora, operator-first infrastructure monitoring for IT/OT environments.

We're excited to launch our public documentation site. Here you'll find everything you need to get up and running with Stratora, from initial setup to advanced configuration.

Head over to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) to begin.

Release notes and product announcements will be posted here going forward.
