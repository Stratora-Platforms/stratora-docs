## v2.1.0 — April 1, 2026

### Disk Capacity Reporting

New PDF report type showing disk usage trends across monitored nodes with projected full dates via linear regression. Available in the Reports engine with Run Now and scheduled delivery.

### Site Photos

Upload and manage photos for each site — equipment, rack layouts, floor plans. Photos are stored securely, served with authentication, and viewable in a lightbox gallery on the site detail page.

### Site Detail Page

Each site now has a dedicated page with eight tabs: Overview, Dashboard, Nodes, Topology, Racks, Alerts, Reports, and Photos. The Overview tab shows node health, device breakdown, and IPAM networks. An attention strip surfaces degraded, critical, and offline nodes at a glance.

### Node Quick Filters

The Nodes tab includes filter toggles (All / Warning / Critical / Offline / Healthy) with live counts, letting you focus on problem nodes without leaving the site context.

### About Page

Settings → About now shows the running platform version, build information, and open source component attribution.

### Bug Fixes & Polish

- Platform version now correctly reported across all API endpoints
- Homepage layout streamlined — cleaner health ring, reordered right rail, reactive accent bar and ambient glow reflecting node health state
- Report template names normalized
