# Integrations Hub

:::info Coming Soon
The Integrations Hub is under active development and will be available in a future release.
:::

The **Integrations Hub** will provide a centralized place to connect Stratora with third-party platforms, IT service management tools, and external systems.

Planned capabilities include:

- **Ticketing systems** — automatically create and update tickets in platforms like ConnectWise, Autotask, and ServiceNow when alerts fire
- **PSA integrations** — sync device inventory and alert status with professional services automation tools
- **API connectors** — connect to custom internal systems via configurable API endpoints
- **Bi-directional sync** — push alert data out and pull configuration or asset data in

---

## What's Available Today

While the Integrations Hub is in development, Stratora already supports delivering alerts to external systems through:

- **[External Notifications](./external-notifications.md)** — Email (SMTP), Slack, Microsoft Teams, and generic webhooks configured on escalation team steps
- **[Email Templates](./email-templates.md)** — customizable HTML email templates with branding and dynamic variables
- **Generic Webhooks** — JSON payloads to any HTTP endpoint, enabling custom integrations with any system that accepts webhooks
