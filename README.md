# Stratora Docs

Public documentation for Stratora — operator-first infrastructure monitoring for IT/OT environments.

Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and deployed to [docs.stratora.io](https://docs.stratora.io) via GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This starts a local dev server at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

This generates static files in the `build/` directory and serves them locally for testing.

## Adding & Editing Docs

- All documentation lives in the `docs/` directory
- Sidebars are autogenerated from the folder structure
- Each folder has a `_category_.json` that controls the sidebar label and position
- Each doc file uses frontmatter for `title`, `sidebar_label`, and optionally `sidebar_position`

### Creating a New Page

1. Add a `.md` file in the appropriate `docs/` subfolder
2. Include frontmatter at the top:

```md
---
sidebar_label: My New Page
title: My New Page
---

# My New Page

Page content here.
```

3. The page will automatically appear in the sidebar

### Creating a New Category

1. Create a new folder under `docs/`
2. Add a `_category_.json` file:

```json
{
  "label": "Category Name",
  "position": 11
}
```

3. Add `.md` files inside the folder

## Versioned Documentation

This site supports versioned docs. When you are ready to snapshot the current docs as a version:

```bash
npm run docusaurus docs:version 1.0
```

This creates:
- `versioned_docs/version-1.0/` — a snapshot of the current `docs/` folder
- `versioned_sidebars/version-1.0-sidebars.json` — the sidebar config for that version
- Updates `versions.json` with the new version

After versioning:
- The `docs/` folder becomes the **Next** (unreleased) version
- The versioned snapshot becomes the default shown to users
- Users can switch between versions via a dropdown in the navbar

## Release Notes

Release notes are managed via the blog feature (route: `/blog`). Add new entries in the `blog/` directory using the standard Docusaurus blog post format.

## Deployment

Deployment is automated via GitHub Actions. Every push to `main` triggers a build and deploy to GitHub Pages. See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
